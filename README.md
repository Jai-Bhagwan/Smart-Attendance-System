# Smart Attendance System Using Face Recognition

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Face Recognition-based Attendance System** built using Python, OpenCV, and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). It automates the attendance process by recognizing faces in real-time and storing records securely.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition  
- Automated attendance marking in CSV file  
- Stores and updates student data efficiently  
- Simple, humanized project approach  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- face_recognition library  
- Pandas, Numpy  

## 📂 Project Structure
- `dataset/` → Images of students  
- `attendance.csv` → Attendance records  
- `main.py` → Main script  
- `encodings.pickle` → Encoded face data
